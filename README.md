This is the solution that I have come up with
Haven't developed any UI, which maybe is a mistake, but anyway, this was my first time working with NODE and Express. I have used Mongo database for this task. Could have finished a little faster, but I had some troubles with the Internet.

git didn't not allow me to upload the node modules, so you'll have to install the dependencies yourself. Feel free to ask me any questions if something is not quite clear about the code I've written
